# Comon Lisp Learning Project

This repository serves as a place where I store my educational materials, experiments, and project templates related to Common Lisp. Here you will find code examples, educational assignments, and project skeletons to help me learn and delve deeper into the world of Common Lisp.

## What you'll find here:

- **Code Examples:** Code that I write while studying Common Lisp, ranging from simple "Hello, world!" examples to more complex tasks.
- **Educational Materials:** Assignments, exercises, and notes that I use in my Common Lisp learning journey.
- **Project Templates:** Ideas and initial structures for future projects in Common Lisp. These templates can serve as a starting point for real-world applications.

## Purpose of this repository:

I'm creating this repository for self-learning and to share my knowledge and experience with other Common Lisp learners. If you are also interested in this powerful and unique programming language, you may find something useful here.

## How to use this repository:

1. Navigate to the **Code Examples** section to view and study my code experiments.
2. In the **Educational Materials** section, you will find assignments and exercises that can assist you in learning Common Lisp.
3. If you have project ideas, refer to the **Project Templates** section for inspiration.

Feel free to contribute your suggestions and improvements. I welcome feedback and collaborative learning!

## How to Install a Common Lisp Interpreter on Linux(Ubuntu):

If you're using Linux and want to start learning Common Lisp, you can install a Common Lisp interpreter such as SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp) by following these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Run the following command to update the package repository:

```shell
sudo apt update
```

3. Install SBCL by running the following command:

```shell
sudo apt install sbcl
```

4. Once the installation is complete, you can start the SBCL interpreter by typing:

```shell
sbcl
```
